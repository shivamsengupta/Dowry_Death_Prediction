# Predicting Dowry Death with Huber Regression

Welcome to the Dowry Death Prediction project! This project focuses on predicting dowry death incidents based on features such as education level, migration class, and employment status using Huber Regression.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the occurrence of dowry death incidents based on socio-economic features.
- **Model**: Utilize Huber Regression, a robust regression technique, for prediction.

## Dataset

- **Data Source**: The dataset used for this project contains information on education level, migration class, employment status, and dowry death incidents.
- **Feature Selection**: Education level, migration class, and employment status were selected as predictor variables based on their potential relevance to dowry death incidents.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- **Huber Regression**: The Huber Regression model was trained on the dataset.
- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of 73.41% in predicting dowry death incidents.


## Future Work

Consider the following for future improvements:

- Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters to potentially improve accuracy.
- Exploring additional features or data sources to enhance prediction capabilities.
- Deploying the model for practical applications or further research.
